Your translation text gets automatically saved after every 3 seconds of inaction.

To explicitly save your translation text, follow the steps below.

-   Click on the **Save** button at the bottom of the screen to save your translation text
    Check the **Time Stamp** (refer [*Main Workspace User Interface*](../../Part-1/Getting-Started/Autographa-Live-User-Interface-Overview/p1-2-2-main-wrkspace-ui.md)) to find the last saved time.
