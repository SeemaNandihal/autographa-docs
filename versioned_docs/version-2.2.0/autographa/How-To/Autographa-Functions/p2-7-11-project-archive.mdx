Projects you don't want to see anymore can be archived if you don't want to delete them entirely.

Autographa allows the user to archive projects. Archiving a project and storing it away for later reference helps to avoid losing data. Backups of the archived projects are maintained by Autographa.

**Steps to archive the project:**

- Select a project from the list to archive
- Click the downward pointing arrow to see a dropdown menu with the project description and three blue dots.
- Click on the blue dots to see a dropdown menu with three options. 
	
<p> Edit </p>
<p> Export </p>
<p> Archive </p>

- Select the archive to save the project for future reference.

**To restore the Archived project**

- Click the Archived button in the top right corner.
- The archived files list appears.
- Choose the Project you want to activate
- Then, select restore by pressing the downward pointing arrow.

The Archive appears in the Sidebar once you archive at least one note. Notes in the Archive do not appear in search results elsewhere, but you can select the Archive section and search its notes.
If you have, archived notes will sync between your devices.
