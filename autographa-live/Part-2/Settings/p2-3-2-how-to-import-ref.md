:::note

Possible reasons for import failures:
Not having a proper /ID tag for the usfm file https://ubsicap.github.io/usfm/identification/books.html
Not having proper chapter tags
Recommendation: You require all the chapters of the book in the usfm for effective functioning of the application.
You can check your usfm file https://usfm.vachanengine.org/
