#  Where do I find my backup folder?
The auto back-up folder is in the same location that you give as the export file location in **_Translation Details_** settings. 

To learn how to select the back-up folder location, refer [Selecting the export folder location for the translation text](../\Getting-Started\Basic-settings-in-Autographa-Live\Setting-up-the-Translation-Details\p1-3-3-4-select-export-folder-location-transltn.md)
